This repository will give you access to the HIKVISION IP Camera of the Casino Hotel CGH Hotel.

The username of the WiFi was already leaked from the frontend of the network. The password was brute forced using a simple python code.
Username - admin
Password - admin

The name of the WiFi is CGH Hotel and it is a captive WiFi. The password was your room number and your last name. After connecting to the Free WiFi, I used NMAP (Network Mapping) to find all the available and open ports. I saw PORT 53/tcp, status OPEN, and running service domain - 53/tcp  open  domain. This was list over 30 times, strongly stating that the port belonged to an IP Camera. After using python, the PUBLIC IP address of the CGH Hotel WiFi was leaked -  117.193.165.172
